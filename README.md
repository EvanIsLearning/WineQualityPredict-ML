This repository contains CSV files with red wine characteristics and machine learning code in python that can do some basic cleaning of the files and then trains on the cleaned csv (i already have a cleaned csv that it reads from by accessing my gitHub repository named 'WineDataTest'.
The model can predict a Red wine's quality with an accuracy of ~96%

Here is the Final output for the predicted vs actual diagram:
